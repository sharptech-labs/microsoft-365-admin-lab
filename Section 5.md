<p>
  I created three Microsoft 365 Groups—Sales Team, Operations Team, and Support Team—and added the appropriate users to each group.
  After creation, I opened each group in Microsoft Teams to provision the corresponding team workspaces.

<h3>Building the Support Team Structure in Microsoft Teams</h3>

<p>
  Inside the Support Team, I created three channels: Tier 1 Support, Tier 2 Escalations, and Documentation.
  These channels mirror a real helpdesk structure and separate frontline support, escalations, and internal documentation.

<h3>Configuring the Tier 1 Support Channel</h3>

<p>
  In the Tier 1 Support channel, I created three folders—Common Issues, Quick Fixes, and User Requests—to organize frontline troubleshooting materials.
  I added a OneNote notebook named <strong>Tier 1 Support Notes</strong> for shift handoffs and quick references.
  I also added multiple Jira Cloud apps to the channel and connected them to Jira filters I created:
  <em>Tier 1 In Progress</em>, <em>Unassigned Tickets</em>, and <em>High Priority (P1/P2)</em>.

<h3>Configuring the Tier 2 Escalations Channel</h3>

<p>
  In the Tier 2 Escalations channel, I created two folders—<strong>Advanced Troubleshooting</strong> and <strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>—to store deeper technical investigations and RCA documentation.
  I added a OneNote notebook named <strong>Tier 2 Escalation Notes</strong> for escalation workflows and technical notes.
  I also added a Jira Cloud app filtered to show tickets marked <em>“Escalated to Tier 2.”</em>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Supports senior technicians with a dedicated escalation workspace, advanced troubleshooting documentation, and filtered visibility into high‑complexity tickets.</p>

<h3>Configuring the Documentation Channel</h3>

<p>
  In the Documentation channel, I created four folders—<strong>KB Articles</strong>, <strong>Onboarding Docs</strong>, <strong>SOPs</strong>, and <strong>System Configurations</strong>—to organize internal knowledge and procedural documentation.
  I added a OneNote notebook named <strong>Support Documentation Notebook</strong> for drafting and storing internal notes.
  Finally, I added a SharePoint app linked directly to the Support Team’s SharePoint site.
