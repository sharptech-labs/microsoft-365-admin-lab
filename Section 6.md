<h2>Section 6 — Shared Mailbox &amp; Distribution List Configuration</h2>

<h3>Creating the Support Shared Mailbox</h3>

<p>
  In the Exchange admin center, I created a shared mailbox for the Support Team.
  After creating it, I assigned the appropriate delegation permissions so that members of the Support Team could read and send mail on behalf of the shared address.

<h3>Creating Distribution Lists</h3>

<p>
  I created three distribution lists: <strong>Tier 1 Support</strong>, <strong>Tier 2 Support</strong>, and <strong>All Support</strong>.
  During creation, I added the correct users to each list based on their department and support role.
  These lists allow messages to be sent to entire support tiers or the entire organization with a single address.
