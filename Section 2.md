<h3>Creating Security Groups</h3>

<p>
  I created department‑based security groups in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, including HR, Sales, Finance, IT, and Operations.
  I also created two role‑based groups: IT Admins for privileged accounts and Standard Users for general user targeting.
  All groups were created as Security groups to support permissions and policy assignments.

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Establishes a clean identity structure for role‑based access control (RBAC) and prepares the tenant for Conditional Access, Intune policy targeting, and department‑specific access management.</p>

<h3>Adding Users to Groups</h3>

<p>
  I added each user to their appropriate department group and assigned admin accounts to the IT Admins group.
  All non‑privileged accounts were added to the Standard Users group.
  Membership was reviewed to ensure each user was placed correctly.
